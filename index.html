						Our theme for this edition is based on the simple question, “What do we do when we face an obstacle that weighs us down?”. While some may choose to stop and take a step back others may move on with the tasks at hand. We believe that knowing where to draw the line in this regard is an essential skill to have in today’s eventful and ever-evolving world. With Alt+F4 we want to give people the ability to take a break, to relax and reassess their choices and to think from a fresher perspective; to close one thought process to give space to the others. Through means of introspective thinking, we thus want to break stereotypes, to understand people, to avoid making the same mistakes and to look for alternative solutions.
