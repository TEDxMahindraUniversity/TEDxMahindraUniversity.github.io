        <p class="userjar">The culmination of mankind's effort. The mother of all necessity. The peak of thought. 

            The cake jar, id est cake in a jar. 
            
            The perfect device with the highest cake-volume to carrying-hassle ratio, the cake jar is the reason why humans have evolved over the past many million years. It is engineered to absolute perfection and beyond doubt flawless.
            
            Lower cretins may believe that the cake pop may be superior, but what they've failed to consider is the hole where their brain is supposed to be. There is no doubt that the cake jar is superior to the cake pop in every way. Many scientists have even put a number! 2-3 times more cake-volume to carrying-hassle ratio is what they've discovered.
            
            My favourite quote is Per Aspera As Astra - Through Hardships To The Stars. Do I believe it? Slightly. Does it need to be modified? Yes. To what?
            
            Through Hardships For The Cake Jar</p>

        <p class="userpop">
            I'd like to refute this sorry attempt at tarnishing the absolutely divine state cake pops hosts as an integral aspect of not just convenient packaged foods, but the coherence that binds us, protects us from the trenches of insanity that the general population so adorably calls routine

The primary point of why cake jars are inferior to cake pops is the lack of creativity. It's a cake, in a jar. You can eat it usiing only one method of execution: a spoon. No other mode of ingestion would prove as efficient as the one intended method, which is where the fallacy of this sorry excuse of innovation lies.
Innovation is bred to inspire, to ignite the flames of curiosity, not to conform to the rigid dogma set by the monopoly of products. The cake jar is inferior in the aspect of having zero freedom, which is where the cake pop enters.

There's is no predefined method of ingestion in a cake pop. You can use a spoon, a fork, your own teeth, your tongue, or you can just use it as a decorative art piece to improve your home. There's no limit to your imagination when it comes to a cake pop. And you get a stick! (which I'll be using to stick up a someone's something)

That being said, I'm not gonna sway your opinions with verbose vocabulary and fancy-sounding words, giving it a falsified mask of professionalism. I'd be doing a disservice to the very philosophy of cake pops if I did follow the path of my beloved ignoramus rival. This philosophy, that I hold so dear to my heart, is that of unalderated simplicity


While the cake pop does boast a varied set of execution methods, at it's very heart, the cake pop is easy to understand. It's simple. The very foundation of what drives humanity and evolution forward is the quest for simplicity. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you (unlike the cake pops I hold so dear to my heart), humans are stupid. No going about it. With the current generation of people descending further and further into the decadence of simplistic lifestyle, the cake jar is far too cumbersome for any average Joe to even comprehend, let alone make it a complete and inseparable part of their lives. The cake pops, in contrast, are childlike. Everything about it could be understood by a 3-year old (who is somehow still older in mental age than my beloved rival, thus explaining his deterrence against cake pops)


To put it simply, cake pop good cake jar bad.

        <h3 class="userjar">Kartik:</h3>
        <p class="userjar">Honestly though, it not only saddens me, but disgusts me that certain members of this team can even have the thought that cake pops and jars are comparable in anyway? Comparing a pop to a jar is like comparing Chetan Bhagat and Shakespeare. There is no comparison. 
            Your childlike demeanour leads you to believe that pops are superior to jars when in actuality there is no empirical evidence to suggest the same. Your fascination with holding things takes your attention away from the real joy, subtlety and convenience of the cake jar. Let's also not forget, the visual appeal.
            
            In short, ur wrong</p>
        <h3 class="userpop">Rishab:</h3>
        <p class="userpop">What makes you think the visual appeal of cake jars trumps cake pops?
            Cake jars are blocky.
            Cake pops are round.</p>
        <h3 class="userjar">Kartik:</h3>
        <p class="userjar">Round is the least exciting shape</p>

        <p class="userjar">Rishab, did you have a deprived childhood. You're just trying to compensate for a sad childhood via the use of "fun" </p>
        <h3 class="userpop">Rishab:</h3>
        <p class="userpop">Here's the thing.
            People have stopped being fun.
            Because they think childlike innocence is somehow inferior.
            Adults are sad because they've become mature and learnt too much about the world that upsets them.
            Ignorance helps to allay these anxiety attacks.</p>

        <h3 class="userjar">Kartik:</h3>
        <p class="userjar">You choose to ignore the fact that mouth feel and volume are directly proportional
            Which is a very important basis of cake consumption</p>
